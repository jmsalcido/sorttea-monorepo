# SortTea Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the SortTea application architecture.

## System Components

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js, React 19, and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. It implements the following features:

- User authentication with NextAuth.js
- Instagram integration for contest management
- Real-time updates using React Query
- Responsive UI with a component-based design

### Backend (Django)

The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework, providing:

- RESTful API for the frontend
- Authentication and authorization
- Instagram API integration
- Background job processing with Celery
- Data persistence with PostgreSQL

## Infrastructure

The application is designed to be deployed with the following infrastructure:

- Frontend: Vercel or similar static hosting
- Backend: Docker containers on a cloud provider
- Database: PostgreSQL database (managed service)
- Cache/Queue: Redis for Celery tasks and caching
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## Data Flow

1. Users authenticate through the frontend
2. Frontend communicates with the backend API
3. Backend interacts with the Instagram API
4. Contest entries are processed and verified
5. Results are stored in the database
6. Frontend displays contest results to users

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are authenticated
- Sensitive information is stored in environment variables
- HTTPS is enforced for all communications
- CORS is configured to restrict access to trusted domains

## Future Considerations

- Implement WebSockets for real-time updates
- Add analytics tracking
- Improve caching strategy
- Add support for multiple social media platforms
